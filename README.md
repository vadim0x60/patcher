Use REST inside your Clojure programs. Represent an edit to a data structure as a data structure (_patch_) and apply it to any nested combination of maps, lists, vectors and sets. 

```clj
[patcher "0.0.0"]
```

## Usage

A patch is a map with 3 keys: `:type`, `:path` and `:value`. `:type` can be `:put`, `:post` and `:delete`.

`:put` will replace whatever value you would get with `(get-in coll path)` with `value`
`:post` is similar, but it will `conj` or `merge` (in case of maps) `value` to existing data instead of replacing it
`:delete` will purge it from the data structure so that `(get-in coll path)` returns `nil`

## Example

`(apply-patch {:type :post :path [:interests] :value :music} {:age 35 :sex :male :interests [:cooking]})`
`=> {:age 35 :sex :male :interests [:cooking :music]}`
